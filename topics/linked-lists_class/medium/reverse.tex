\question Write a function \texttt{reverse}, which takes in a \texttt{Link} and
returns a new \texttt{Link} that has the order of the contents reversed.\\
\emph{Hint:} You may want to use a helper function if you're solving this
recursively.
\begin{lstlisting}
def reverse(lst):
    """
    >>> a = Link(1, Link(2, Link(3)))
    >>> b = reverse(a)
    >>> b
    Link(3, Link(2, Link(1)))
    >>> a
    Link(1, Link(2, Link(3)))
    """
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}[1in]
There are quite a few different methods. We have listed some here -- can you
think of any others?
\begin{lstlisting}
# Recursive w/ Helper
def reverse(lst):
    def helper(so_far, rest):
        if rest is Link.empty:
            return so_far
        else:
            return helper(Link(rest.first, so_far), rest.rest)
    return helper(Link.empty, lst)

# Iterative
def reverse(lst):
    rev = Link.empty
    while lst is not Link.empty:
        rev = Link(lst.first, rev)
        lst = lst.rest
    return rev
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
