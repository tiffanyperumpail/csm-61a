In this problem, we will be implementing a new ant into Ants vs. Some Bees. 
The bees are winning too often, so deep in the research labs of CSM 61A, we've developed a new ant.
called a Clone Ant. The more clone ants that exist, the more powerful each clone ant becomes! Specifically,
the damage of each clone ant is equal to the total number of clone ants that exist in the world when the clone ant is created.
