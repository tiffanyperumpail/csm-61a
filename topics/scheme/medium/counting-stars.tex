\question \textbf{Counting Stars}
Alice goes out to look for shooting stars every evening and records how many she sees each evening. One day, she decides to write a Scheme program to figure out how many times she has seen a certain number of stars, and she asks you for help. She wants to put in her record as a Scheme list and return a new list with the number of stars and the number of times she saw that number of stars. Write the program that would satisfy Aliceâ€™s request.

\begin{lstlisting}
; Doctests
> (counter 4 '(1 3 2 3 4 4 7))
(4 2)
> (counter 6 '(1 2 3 4 5))
(6 0)
> (counter 3 '(1 2 3 4 5))
(3 1)

(define (counter x lst)
    (define (helper rest count)




    )
    
)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{solution}
\begin{lstlisting}
(define (counter x lst)
    (define (helper rest count)
        (cond
            ((null? rest) (list x count))
            ((equal? x (car rest)) (helper (cdr rest) (+ count 1)))
            (else (helper (cdr rest) count))
         )
    )
    (helper lst 0)
)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{solution}
